#program flow
    websocket connection
    users logins or registers : user/login/name
        new user obj created with his socketID
        server obj is notified and adds this user to users array
    user sends message : user/send/name/message



#Controller test
the controller should be able to delgate action based on string like url
    in: string "class/action/param1/param2"
    out : 

###problem: how do i send a message with this ?
solutions: 
    * message is 1 of the params if message has slashes it will be cut into an array
    * __go back to json__
    * send the message in 2 parts, 1 for the action the other for the message

###problem: whats the best way to pass the db handle between classes ?
solution: pass in the connection object:

## Login query
    if user exits update session col if not create new user and set session col

## problem: how to pass the user socket handle to the user object
    * what command to we need ?
            login
            logout
            getActiveUsers
            sendMsg

    * integrate the controller into the Server ?
    * Observer pattern: when user is logged in update user array in server

## we don't want to create a new object each time a user send an action

## observer 
    server class is an observer of the user class
    k
## why do i need a controller class ?
    * less dependency 


   possible chat actions:
   user/login/name
   user/send/name/msg
   chatApp/getActive users

   user1 | user2 | message | timestamp
   1        2       hi          23
   1        2       what ?      25
   2

   select * from conversation where (user_one = '2' and user_two = '10') or (user_one = '10' and user_two = '2') order by timestamp
   insert into conversation (user_one,user_two,message)  values(1,2,'hii ther')
